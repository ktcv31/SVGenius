#SVGenius

SVGenius is a command-line application that generates simple, custom SVG logos based on user input. The application allows users to select a shape (circle, triangle, or square), specify colors for both the shape and the text, and provide up to three characters for the logo text. The generated SVG file is saved as logo.svg and can be easily viewed in any web browser or SVG-compatible software.
